# 1. Goal
We will learn how to manage Python

# 2. What is `uv`

> [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.

You can read more about it in the [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Now I will explain why in my own words.

# 3. Why `uv`?

Before we answer this question, we have to understand what a `Python project` is.

Look at this [pandas github](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) as an example.

It is a lot, and you probably don't know where the source code of the `Pandas` is.
But that is because you don't know the "Standard Practice" of a Python project.
If we use a project management tool like `uv`, it helps us to be in a certain standard practice.
